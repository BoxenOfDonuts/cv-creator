# Resume Creator
This project is my first attempt at using Create React App and Class based components.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
Holy cow... this was hard. By the time I was done with the pure JS projects, I woudln't say it was easy, but I generally felt confident. This application however... this made me think "what the heck am I even doing" more than once. I'm glad I pushed through it though and am happy that it is working. This thing is definitely in need of a refactor, but at this point i'm just happy its working :sob:
